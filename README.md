# Two Way Slider

Sometimes we need two way slider to handler max and min value more easily. But it seems there are no react library to do that.

I've tried to implement two-way slider using react and Rx. I wish it could be more flexible to use.

## TODO

1. Refactor: the code is not really clear. I'll refactor it after I completed this component and add test suite.

2. Flexibility:

3. Add test
